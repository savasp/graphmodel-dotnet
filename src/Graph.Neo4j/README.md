**Neo4j provider** for CVOYA graph - enables your applications to work with Neo4j graph databases using the CVOYA graph abstractions and LINQ-style querying.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
dotnet add package Cvoya.Graph.Neo4j
```

```csharp
using Cvoya.Graph.Neo4j;

// Configure connection
var store = new Neo4jGraphStore("neo4j+s://your-server:7687", "neo4j", "your-password");
var graph = store.Graph;

// Use CVOYA graph APIs
var users = await (await graph.NodesAsync<User>())
    .Where(u => u.IsActive)
    .OrderBy(u => u.CreatedDate)
    .ToListAsync();
```

## 📦 Core Features

- **Full CVOYA graph compatibility** - Works seamlessly with all CVOYA graph abstractions
- **Cypher query generation** - Automatic translation from LINQ to optimized Cypher
- **Connection pooling** - Built-in connection management and pooling
- **Transaction support** - Full ACID transactions with Neo4j
- **Index management** - Automatic index creation from entity attributes
- **Complex type handling** - Serialization of complex properties and collections

## 🏗️ Architecture

This provider implements:

- **`IGraph`** - Main graph operations against Neo4j
- **`IGraphQueryProvider`** - LINQ-to-Cypher query translation
- **`IGraphTransaction`** - Neo4j transaction wrapper
- **Connection management** - Efficient Neo4j driver usage

## 🔧 Configuration

```csharp
var store = new Neo4jGraphStore("neo4j+s://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password");
var graph = store.Graph;
```

### Concurrent schema initialization

Independent `Neo4jGraphStore` instances may safely initialize the same database at the same time,
including configured constraints, range indexes, and the provider's general full-text indexes.
Retryable Neo4j schema failures are replayed through driver-managed transactions. If concurrent
creation reports a non-retryable schema conflict, the provider treats it as success only when the
installed object's name, entity type, labels or relationship types, properties, and schema kind are
equivalent to the requested definition. An incompatible existing object still fails with the
original Neo4j error.

The provider-owned general full-text indexes (`node_fulltext_index` and `rel_fulltext_index`) are
the exception: their exact names and matching node/relationship full-text kinds are reserved as
the ownership marker. Their definition is derived from the whole registered model, so it
legitimately changes as the model evolves. When their installed definition no longer matches the
current model, the provider drops and recreates them during initialization instead of failing.

`RecreateManagedIndexesAsync` rebuilds only positively owned indexes. A configured range index is
owned only when its deterministic name, kind, entity type, label/type, and properties all match the
current registered model. A stale range index that is no longer described by that model is
preserved because its ownership can no longer be proved. The two exact reserved full-text indexes
remain positively owned when their model-derived definition is stale; they are rebuilt when still
configured and removed when the current model no longer requires them. External indexes,
same-named incompatible range indexes, and every uniqueness-backed index are preserved.

Calls on one graph instance are serialized. Independent equivalent callers converge on the same
installed definitions through metadata-checked conflict handling. Callers using different models
against the same database must coordinate their maintenance operations. Cancellation or failure
can leave only a positively owned index absent; retrying the operation restores the configured
managed set without expanding the ownership boundary.
