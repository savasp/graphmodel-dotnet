  ```bash
  dotnet build --configuration Release
  ```

- [ ] **Review analyzer warnings** - Fix or document exceptions
- [ ] **Code coverage analysis** - Ensure adequate coverage
- [x] **Dependency vulnerability scan** âœ… (Automated workflow created)
- [x] **Code coverage reporting** âœ… (Comprehensive coverage with Codecov integration)
- [ ] **License compatibility check** for all dependencies

## ðŸ”§ Technical Preparation

### Build System

- [ ] **Verify NuGet package metadata** in `.csproj` files
  - [ ] Package descriptions
  - [ ] Authors and copyright
  - [ ] Repository URLs
  - [ ] License information
  - [ ] Version numbers
- [ ] **Test NuGet package creation**

  ```bash
  dotnet pack --configuration Release
  ```

- [ ] **Verify package symbols and documentation**

### CI/CD

- [x] **Add release workflow** âœ… for automated publishing
- [x] **Add dependency review** âœ… for pull requests
- [x] **Add code quality checks** âœ… (CodeQL, Neo4j compatibility, performance)

### Repository Hygiene

- [ ] **Clean up development artifacts**
  - [ ] Remove or move `possible-futures/` directory
  - [ ] Remove `Task.md` after fixing issues
  - [ ] Review and clean `artifacts/` directory
  - [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` is comprehensive
- [ ] **Review commit history** - Consider squashing development commits
- [ ] **Tag stable points** in development

## ðŸ“‹ Legal and Compliance

### Licensing

- [x] Apache 2.0 license is in place
- [ ] **Verify license headers** in source files (if required)
- [ ] **Third-party license review** - Document all dependencies
- [ ] **Patent review** (if applicable)

### Security

- [x] Security policy documented
- [ ] **Security scan** of all dependencies
- [x] **Static security analysis** âœ… of code (CodeQL workflow)
- [ ] **Review default configurations** for security

## ðŸŽ¯ Pre-Release Testing

### Integration Testing

- [x] **Test with different Neo4j versions** âœ… (Automated workflow created)
  - [x] Neo4j 5.13-5.17+ (workflow tests multiple versions)
  - [ ] Neo4j 4.x (if needed for compatibility)
- [ ] **Test on different platforms**
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] macOS
  - [ ] Linux
- [ ] **Test with different .NET versions**
  - [ ] .NET 8.0
  - [ ] .NET 9.0 (if available)

### User Experience Testing

- [ ] **Follow getting started guide from scratch**
- [ ] **Test all code examples in documentation**
- [ ] **Verify IntelliSense and analyzer experience**
- [ ] **Test error messages are helpful**

## ðŸš€ Release Preparation

### Version Planning

- [ ] **Choose initial version number** (suggest 1.0.0)
- [ ] **Plan semantic versioning strategy**
- [ ] **Document breaking changes** (for future releases)

### Communication

- [ ] **Prepare release notes**
- [ ] **Plan announcement strategy**
- [ ] **Prepare demo/presentation materials**
- [ ] **Update social media profiles/websites**

### Post-Release Planning

- [x] **Set up issue templates** âœ… for GitHub (bug, feature, docs, questions)
- [ ] **Plan community engagement strategy**
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for adoption metrics
- [ ] **Plan first patch release timeline**

## âœ… Final Checklist

Before creating the release:

- [ ] All critical issues are resolved
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Security review is complete
- [ ] Legal review is complete
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
